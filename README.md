# OpenFOAM-oscillatingRotatingOffsetMotion

This boundary conditon for OpenFOAM allows to have an oscillating mesh motion *with an initial offset*.

It is currently compatible with OpenFOAM-v1812 from [OpenFOAM.com](http://www.openfoam.com).

To compile this new AMI motion function, simply put the folder into your user directory and run *wmake* from inside the folder.
